Here are the solutions of course Namaste SQL by Ankit Bansal

## RDBMS
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

## SQL Statements
Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.
SQL statements consist of keywords that are easy to understand.

## Database Tables
A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"), and contain records (rows) with data.

## Keep in Mind That...
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT

#### Semicolon after SQL Statements?
Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

## RDBMS
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.
The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

## SQL Statements
Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.
SQL statements consist of keywords that are easy to understand.

## Database Tables
A database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"), and contain records (rows) with data.

## Keep in Mind That...
SQL keywords are NOT case sensitive: select is the same as SELECT

#### Semicolon after SQL Statements?
Some database systems require a semicolon at the end of each SQL statement.
Semicolon is the standard way to separate each SQL statement in database systems that allow more than one SQL statement to be executed in the same call to the server.

## SQL CREATE DATABASE
The CREATE DATABASE statement is a foundational SQL command used to create new databases in SQL-based Database Management Systems (DBMS), including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and others. Understanding how to use this command effectively is crucial for developers, database administrators, and anyone working with relational databases.

### CREATE DATABASE in SQL
The CREATE DATABASE command establishes a new database within your SQL ecosystem. A database is a repository that organizes data in structured formats through tables, views, stored procedures, and other components.
The syntax to use the CREATE DATABASE command in SQL is:
```
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```
### List Databases in SQL
we will verify whether the new database that we have just created has been successfully added to our system or not. 
We use the SHOW DATABASES command and it will return a list of databases that exist in our system.
```
SHOW DATABASES;
```
### USE Database in SQL
Once your database is created, we can switch to that database to begin adding tables, inserting data, and performing queries. To do this, use the USE command.
```
USE database_name
```
### Delete a Database in SQL
If you ever need to remove a database, the DROP DATABASE command can be used to delete the database and all its contents:
```
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```
### Rename Database
To change the name of a database in SQL, use the syntax:
```
ALTER DATABASE [current_database_name]
MODIFY NAME = [new_database_name];
```
To rename a database in MySQL use the query:
```
RENAME DATABASE [current_database_name] TO [new_database_name];
```

## CREATE TABLE
The SQL CREATE TABLE statement is a foundational command used to define and structure a new table in a database. By specifying the columns, data types, and constraints such as PRIMARY KEY, NOT NULL, and CHECK, helps you design the database schema.  A tableâ€™s structure, including column names, data types, and constraints like NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY, and CHECK, are defined when it is created in SQL.
```
CREATE table table_name
(
Column1 datatype (size),
column2 datatype (size),
.
.
columnN datatype(size)
);
```

```
Note : I am using DBeaver, so for inserting multiline data you have to run query as script (alt+x).
```

## Some of The Most Important SQL Commands
```
SELECT - extracts data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index
```

## The SQL SELECT Statement
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```
### The SQL SELECT DISTINCT Statement
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values.
```
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

## SQL WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
### Operators
The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause:
```
Operator	Description	
=	        Equal	
>	        Greater than	
<	        Less than	
>=	        Greater than or equal	
<=	        Less than or equal	
<>	        Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
BETWEEN	        Between a certain range	
LIKE	        Search for a pattern	
IN	        To specify multiple possible values for a column
```
